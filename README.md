# europeGame

This is my first project posted on Github. I've been longing to create a simple project on Python and I finally finished it. 

If you guys are aware of the website "Sporcle", its a website where you can do a variety of quizzes. Amongst these are games where you must enter (as much) countries as you can on specific continents. In my game, I recreated the Europe game where the user must enter maximun of 20 countries from the European Continent. There are instructions you must read before you start playing.

Have fun!
